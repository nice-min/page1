h3. Eclipse Fundamentals

* *Workbench* : The term workbench is used to describe the environment in which all of your work will be done. The workbench contains the menu bar and tool bars, and one or more perspectives.
* *Perspective* : A perspective is a special layout of particular views and tools that you will need to use in your work. The currently open perspective will occupy most of the Eclipse workbench. You may have more than one perspective open at a time, but only the active one will be visible. Other open perspectives can be accessed quickly by small buttons in a toolbar on the upper right-hand side of the workbench.
* *View* : Views are designed to support interaction with the information in your workbench. Eclipse is designed to be extensible, so views can be designed to show nearly any kind of information. 
* *Menu Bar and Tool Bars* : These are exactly as you would expect from any graphical user interface (GUI) application. They contain the commands to perform many common tasks such as saving and editing files.
